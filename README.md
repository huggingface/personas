Datasets for Deep learning Personas

***TL;DR:*** These are the datasets that we've used in our fun AI side project experiment, over at http://personas.huggingface.co/

We've trained seq2seq models using [DeepQA](https://github.com/Conchylicultor/DeepQA), a tensorflow implementation of "A neural conversational model" (a.k.a. the Google paper), a Deep learning based chatbot.

## Datasets used

 * [Cornell Movie Dialogs](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html) corpus
 * Supreme Court Conversation Data.
 * [Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08909) for tech-support type discussion.
 * [Stack Exchange Data Dump](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange)
 
This is an anonymized dump of all user-contributed content on the Stack Exchange network. Each site is formatted as a separate archive consisting of XML files zipped via 7-zip using bzip2 compression. Each site archive includes Posts, Users, Votes, Comments, PostHistory and PostLinks.
